Help me create and deploy a cross-platform mobile app using **Expo and React Native** for an online competition platform called **Score4Me**. The app should have the following features:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register with a username, email, and password.
   - Users can log in and log out.
   - Passwords should be securely stored.

2. **Competitions**:
   - Competitions are divided into two streams:
     - **Individual Competitions**: For individual users.
     - **Business Competitions**: For businesses (e.g., Best AI Agent, Best Robot, or other products).
   - Competitions are created by admins or businesses (not regular users).
   - Competitions have the following fields:
     - **General Fields** (for both Individual and Business Competitions):
       - Title, description, category, prize amount.
       - Start date, end date, and status (active/inactive).
     - **Business-Specific Fields**:
       - Product name.
       - Product description (detailed information about the product).
       - Product image or promotional banner.
   - Users can view a list of active competitions in a scrollable feed, with filters for Individual and Business competitions.

3. **Category Suggestions**:
   - Users can suggest new categories for competitions.
   - Admins can approve or reject category suggestions.

4. **Submissions**:
   - Users can submit entries to competitions (e.g., photos, videos, music, lyrics).
   - Submissions can be rated by other users on a scale of 1 to 10.
   - Users can view submissions and their average ratings.

5. **Business Features**:
   - Businesses can sponsor competitions.
   - Business competitions can have additional features (e.g., product showcases, promotional banners).
   - Premium users (individuals or businesses) can have additional features (e.g., more votes, exclusive competitions).

6. **Frontend**:
   - Use React Native for the frontend with TailwindCSS (via a library like `nativewind`).
   - Include components for:
     - Competition cards (with labels for Individual or Business).
     - Submission forms.
     - Voting interfaces.
     - User profiles.
     - Category suggestion forms.
   - Add a toggle or tab system to switch between Individual and Business competitions.
   - Ensure the product description field is displayed prominently in Business Competition details.

7. **Backend**:
   - Use **Supabase** for:
     - Authentication (login, sign-up, logout).
     - Database (competitions, submissions, ratings, category suggestions).
     - File storage (user uploads like photos, videos).
   - Implement real-time updates for competitions and submissions.

8. **Replit Setup and Deployment**:
   - Set up the project on Replit, including connecting to a GitHub repository (if applicable).
   - Configure environment variables (e.g., Supabase keys) in Replit.
   - Ensure the app runs smoothly in Replitâ€™s development environment.
   - Provide instructions for testing the app locally using Expo Go.
   - Guide me on how to deploy the app for web access via Replit.

Provide the complete code for the app, including all necessary files and step-by-step instructions for setup and deployment on Replit."
