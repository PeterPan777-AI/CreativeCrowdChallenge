I need assistance in setting up a leaderboard system for my app, VoteNest, where users will be able to vote on entries in various competition categories (e.g., Best AI Tool, Cutest Cat, etc.) on a 0-10 scale. I want to have separate leaderboards for each category to display the top-rated entries based on user votes.

Here’s what I need help with:

Category-based Leaderboards:

Each competition category (e.g., Best AI Tool, Cutest Cat, etc.) needs its own leaderboard.

Ranking Based on 0-10 Voting Scale:

Each user will rate submissions on a scale from 0 to 10.

I need to calculate the average rating for each submission to determine the ranking (e.g., total score / number of votes).

Total Votes and Average Rating:

The leaderboard should display the total votes a submission has received and the average rating (to prevent single high votes from skewing the rankings).

A weighting system (optional) could be used if you want to give more weight to higher-quality votes, such as those from verified or premium users.

Real-time Updates:

The leaderboard should update dynamically as users cast their votes. Users should see the updated rankings in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

Top Entries:

The leaderboard should only show the Top 10 or Top 5 entries for each category. This keeps the display clean and manageable.

I want to make sure the entries are sorted by average rating, and optionally, by the number of votes if that’s a factor.

User Profiles and Rankings:

I’d like users to see their current ranking within a category, along with the number of votes their submission has received and their average score.

Leaderboard Layout:

Each leaderboard should show the submission’s name, average rating, total votes, and user profile (including their picture and username).

Please guide me on how to:

Set up the database structure to track votes, ratings, and rankings.

Handle the logic to compute average ratings and total votes.

Create the API calls to update the leaderboards in real-time as users vote.
